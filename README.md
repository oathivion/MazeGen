This software genertates mazes and solves them with etheir DFS or BFS. 

{Describe your purpose for writing this software.}
I write this because I like to watch the mazes get solved.
{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}
